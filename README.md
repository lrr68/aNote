# anote

POSIX shell script for taking notes and viewing them in the terminal.
Notes are saved in plain text files in $NOTES_PATH directory or $HOME/.notes if $NOTES_PATH is not set.
run 'anote -h' for help.

I recommend adding anote.sh to $PATH and make a 'anote' alias so you don't have to type anote.sh everytime.

# TODO
+ make a way to use it without dmenu
